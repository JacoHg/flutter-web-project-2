# flutter_web_3

This website was made for my own learning purposes and i definitely learned alot from this project, as you will see there is definitely more room for improvement.
Building this website was alot of fun, but it needs alot more work espesially clean up work.
I will try to finish this website in the future however as for right now there are still many things to learn for me and so i need to move on to new more challenging projects.

Features:
-Rotating carousel widget.
-Responsive design.
-Interactive categorys.
-App bar hover animation.
